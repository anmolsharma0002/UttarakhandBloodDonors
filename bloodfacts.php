7.  Red blood cells develop in bone marrow and circulate in the body for around 120 days.<br>
8.  Donors can give either whole blood or specific blood components only. The process of donating specific blood components – red cells, plasma or platelets – is called apheresis.<br>
9.  Donated platelets must be used within five days of collection.<br>
10. One transfusion dose of platelets can be obtained through one apheresis donation of platelets or by combining the platelets derived from five whole blood donations.<br>
11. An adult body has 100,000 kilometers or 60,000 miles of blood vessels running throughout the body.<br>
12. Though we are familiar with common blood types A, B, AB and O, which is a part of simplified ABO system, there are actually around 30 different recognized blood groups or blood types.<br>
13. Blood is not just responsible for carrying oxygen to different parts of the body.It also carries nutrients to body cells.At the same time,it also carries away unwanted waste material away from the cells.<br>
14. Only the red blood cells in our blood are responsible for carrying oxygen.<br>
15. Platelets are completely different and are responsible for blood clotting whenever bleeding occurs because of a cut or bruise.This prevents unwanted loss of blood.<br>
16. The average volume of blood present in an adult male body is 5.6 liters while an adult female body contains 4.5 liters of blood on an average.<br>
17. Average blood pressure will always vary from one person to another despite the fact that  standard considered BP is 112/64 mmHg.<br>
18. High BP implies increased risk of stroke and heart attack.<br>
19. Blood pressure is actually the pressure exerted by blood on blood vessel walls. BP is  a vital sign of life.<br>
20. Platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells are all found floating in blood plasma.<br>

<label>Why Donate Blood?</label>

<p>
1. As you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.<br>

2. Every year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available.<br>

3. Saving a life does not require heroic deeds. You could just do it with a small thought and an even smaller effort for saying "yes".<br>

4. Blood is the living fluid that all life is based on.<br>

5. Blood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part.<br>

6. The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food, medicines, etc. But the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable time to be replaced if lost.<br>
 
7. One out of every three will need blood in our life time.<br>

8. There is no substitute for Blood.<br>

9. Every two seconds, someone needs blood.<br>

</p>


<label><font style="color:red;font-family:arial black"><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> While you're reading this, someone in India needs blood.  Someone has to donate blood for someone to receive blood</font></label>
<p>
1. Only 2% of the eligible population donates blood.<br>

2. The need for blood increases by 5% every year.<br>

3. 75% donors donate only once a year.  If they donated twice a year, there will never be any shortage of blood.<br>

4. Blood can be donated by any volunteer, a person from among us, who makes the choice to donate blood. When you donate blood, you join a very select group, currently only 0.8 out of every 100 people in India donate blood.You have the power to make a difference in someone's life. All you have to do is make a contribution. Every donation helps to save 3-4 lives, your contributions can help bring comfort to those in need.

<label>Facts about Donors</label>
<p>
1. The number one reason donors say they give blood is because they "want to help others."<br>
2. Two most common reasons cited by people who don't give blood are: "Never thought about it" and "I don't like needles."<br>
3. One donation can help save the lives of up to three people.<br>
4. If you began donating blood at age 18 and donated every 90 days until you reached 60, you would have donated 30 gallons of blood, potentially helping save more than 500 lives!.<br>
5. Only 7 percent of people in India have O-negative blood type. O-negative blood type donors are universal donors as their blood can be given to people of all blood types.<br>
6. Type O-negative blood is needed in emergencies before the patient's blood type is known and with newborns who need blood.<br>
7. Thirty-five percent of people have Type O (positive or negative) blood.<br>
8. 0.4 percent of people have AB-blood type. AB-type blood donors are universal donors of plasma, which is often used in emergencies, for newborns and for patients requiring massive transfusions.
